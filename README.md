Data Analysis of Toronto Police data about the crimes. 

The main goal of this project is to understand the most dangerous areas of Toronto depending on a type of crime.
We can understand where in Toronto it is not a great idea to leave your car unattended for a long time.
Where is the best thing to keep a door of your apartment or house closed. As well as where you should avoid walking by yourself as there is a higher chance of being robbed. Also, the project uses google maps api so it provides the address of the most dangerous area.
